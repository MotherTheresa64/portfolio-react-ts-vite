        I'm Noah Ragan, a full stack software engineer with hands-on experience
        building modern web applications using technologies like React, TypeScript,
        Flask, and SQL. I’ve completed a comprehensive full-stack bootcamp at
        Coding Temple, where I built real-world projects and developed skills in
        REST APIs, authentication, CI/CD, testing, and responsive design.
